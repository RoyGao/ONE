This folder contains two datasets

1. Citeseer (seeded) dataset
2. WebKB (seeded) dataset

Each of the datasets contain 4 files

struct.csv ==> This is the adjacency matris of the network
content.csv ==> This file contains semantic information associated with each node in the network.
label.csv  ==> This file contains the label associated with each node
permutation.csv ==> This file contains the permutation index of nodes in the network. i.e.
		     For Example
			Original Citeseer network has 3312 nodes and we seeded 5% ie 180 nodes and the resulting seeded network has 3312+180 = 3492 nodes.
			A node is a seeded node (i.e. an outlier) if its permutation index is > 3312

We observed experimentally that to detect outliers, it is better to give higher weightage to outlier score 2 (O_2) than outlier scores 1 and 3.
